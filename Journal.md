AAD116
======

###Week 1
=========
In week one of the course we had an induction on what would be expected of us and what we would be covering over the next 12 weeks within the AAD116 module which is an Introduction to Communication and design. 
####Friday Lecture
In our first AAD116 lecture we covered some ground on what we should be doing within this module and what we should do to broaden our knowledge so that we can become better designers and learn from the knowledge we are taking in. To broaden our knowledge and our understanding of design history we were told about a few artists such as...
- Dieter Rams 
- Jonathan Ive 
- Guillermo del Toro 

The designer that stood out for me was Johnathan Ive as i knew a little bit about him such as he worked very closely with Steve Jobs at apple and actually came up with design of the first iMac Computer.
